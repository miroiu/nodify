- If you find a **Closed** issue that relates to yours, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.
- The easiest way to update documentation is to navigate [to the docs website](https://miroiu.github.io/nodify/docs/) and click 'Edit this page' which is found at the bottom of any page.
- If you want to create an example application that others can use to learn from, then [create an issue](https://github.com/miroiu/nodify/issues/new?assignees=miroiu&labels=application&template=add_example_app.md&title=%5BApplication%5D) describing what your application is doing and if you need help with anything.
- The application you showcase can use any license.
